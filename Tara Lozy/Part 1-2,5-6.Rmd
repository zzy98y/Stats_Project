The mean from Part 1 = 121.1530. The population mean fits within both sets of confidence intervals. The confidence interval calculated from the data set with n = 100, (119.0775, 123.9601) would be more accurate since it was calculated from a larger data set.

# Part 6 ----

# 1. 2 - sided T-test on Sample Set ETF6, H0: u = 100 at Confidence Level = 95%
t.test(ETF6, mu = 100)
```

The t-test result does not support the H0: u = 100 as the p-value is extremely small and < significance level of 0.05. Therefore, the data set's mean, selected in Part 5, Step 1, is not equal to 100.

```{r}
# 2. 2-sided T-test on Sample Set ETF26, H0: u = 100 at Confidence Level = 95%
t.test(ETF26, mu = 100)
```

The t-test result does not support the H0: u = 100 as the p-value is extremely small and < significance level of 0.05. Therefore, the data set's mean, selected in Part 5, Step 2, is not equal to 100.

```{r}
install.packages("EnvStats")
library(EnvStats)
# 3. 2-sided Chi-Squared Test on Sample Set ETF26, sigma = 225 at Confidence Level = 95%
varTest(ETF26, sigma.squared = 225)
```
In order to run the Chi-Squared test, I set the variance to 225 (i.e. 15 x 15) The Chi-Squared Test result supports the H0: σ = 15 as the p-value > significance level.

```{r}
# 4. 1-sided Chi-Sqaured Test on Sample Set ETF25, sigma = 225 at Conficence Level = 95%
varTest(ETF26, alternative = "less", sigma.squared = 225)
```

The Chi-Squared Test result supports the H0: σ = 15 as the p-value > significance level.
